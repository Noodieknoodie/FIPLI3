# FIPLI - Financial Planning Lite

## Project Overview

FIPLI is a specialized financial planning tool designed to help financial advisors model and compare different retirement scenarios for their clients. At its core, the system enables advisors to enter a household's complete financial picture - their assets, liabilities, income streams, and future events - and then create multiple "what-if" scenarios to explore different retirement strategies.

The system's key strength lies in its flexible scenario modeling. Starting with a household's base financial facts, advisors can create variations that modify any aspect of the financial picture - from changing growth rates and retirement ages to adjusting specific assets or income streams. Each scenario maintains its connection to the base facts while storing only the modified values, allowing for efficient comparison of different retirement strategies.

A distinguishing feature is the system's sophisticated handling of the retirement nest egg. While tracking a household's total net worth, FIPLI allows advisors to designate specific assets for inclusion in retirement calculations. This separation enables clear visualization of retirement-specific resources while maintaining a complete picture of the client's wealth. The system applies a hierarchical growth rate system, where assets can follow the default nest egg growth rate, maintain independent growth rates, or use time-specific growth adjustments for modeling events like real estate appreciation or market conditions.

FIPLI's calculation engine processes each scenario year by year, carefully tracking how the nest egg evolves through asset growth, cash flows, and retirement spending. It maintains detailed surplus tracking, showing not just the final nest egg balance but also how surpluses accumulate and grow over time. This approach provides deeper insight into retirement sustainability and helps advisors optimize spending strategies across different growth assumptions.

The system is built around the concept of a reference person, whose timeline anchors all calculations, while seamlessly handling joint ownership and household-level planning. This design supports everything from basic retirement projections to complex scenarios involving property sales, varying income streams, and sophisticated growth patterns, all while maintaining computational accuracy and scenario comparison capabilities.

## Introduction
As a financial advisor, FIPLI is your go-to tool for creating and comparing retirement scenarios for clients and prospects. This guide walks through how to use the system from start to finish, focusing on what you can actually do with it rather than the technical details.

## Getting Started: Households and People

### Creating a Household
Everything in FIPLI starts with creating a household. This is pretty straightforward - you enter the household name, and you're ready to add the people. Think of this as creating your client folder.

### Adding People
For each household member, you'll enter:
- First and last name
- Date of birth
- Retirement age
- Final age (how long to project their plan)

A key point here: FIPLI uses one person as the "reference person" for the household. This is usually the primary earner or the person whose retirement age drives the major planning decisions. Their timeline becomes the foundation for all the projections.

## Creating the Financial Plan

Once you've got your household set up, you create a plan. This is where the real work begins. The plan creation is your starting point for all scenario modeling. You'll select:
- Plan name (I usually use something like "Smith Family Retirement Plan 2025")
- Which person is the reference person
- The year the plan starts (usually current year)

### Base Assumptions
Every plan needs some fundamental assumptions. These are your starting points that you can later modify in different scenarios:
- Default nest egg growth rate (typically around 6% for balanced portfolios)
- Inflation rate (usually 2-3%)
- Annual retirement spending target (the amount your clients want to spend in retirement)

## Asset Management

### Categories
First, you'll want to set up asset categories. These help organize everything and make reporting cleaner. Common categories I use:
- Retirement Accounts (401(k)s, IRAs)
- Real Estate
- Taxable Investments
- Cash/Emergency Fund
- Business Interests

### Adding Assets
For each asset, you can specify:
- Category it belongs to
- Current value
- Whether it should be included in the nest egg calculations
- If it should use its own growth rate instead of the default
- Who owns it (single or joint ownership)

A really powerful feature is the ability to set "growth adjustments" for specific time periods. For example, if you know a rental property will appreciate faster for the next 5 years due to development in the area, you can set a higher growth rate just for that period.

I find this particularly useful when modeling:
- Real estate appreciation in hot markets
- Business value growth during expansion phases
- Conservative growth periods near retirement
- Market recovery periods after downturns

## Liability Tracking

The liability system mirrors assets but with some key differences. For each liability, you track:
- Category (mortgages, student loans, etc.)
- Current balance
- Interest rate
- Whether it should reduce the nest egg value

What's great about this setup is you can model how liabilities impact the retirement picture over time. I often use this to show clients the impact of:
- Paying off their mortgage before retirement
- Accelerating debt paydown vs investing more
- Taking on new debt for major purchases



## Cash Flow Management

### Regular Inflows and Outflows
This is where FIPLI really shines. You can model pretty much any type of cash flow your clients might have:

#### Inflows
- Regular salary/wages
- Rental income
- Bonus payments
- Future inheritances
- Business income
- Asset sales

#### Outflows
- Regular expenses
- Future major purchases
- Education costs
- Healthcare expenses
- Property taxes
- Insurance premiums

What makes this powerful is how flexible the timing can be. For each cash flow, you can:
- Set specific start and end years
- Choose whether it grows with inflation
- Make it a one-time event (by setting start and end year the same)

I use this all the time to model things like:
- Kids' college expenses (4-year outflows starting at specific ages)
- Downsizing homes (one-time inflow from sale, one-time outflow for purchase)
- Gradual retirement (declining income over several years)
- Future wedding expenses
- Car replacements every X years

### Retirement Income Planning

This is separate from regular cash flows because it's specifically tied to retirement benefits. You can add:
- Social Security benefits (with different start ages)
- Pension payments
- Annuity income
- Deferred compensation payouts

The cool thing here is you can:
- Set different start ages for each income source
- Specify whether benefits increase with inflation
- Model joint and survivor benefits
- Set duration (lifetime or specific period)

Pro tip: I often create multiple scenarios with different Social Security claiming strategies to show clients the long-term impact of waiting vs. claiming early.

## Scenario Modeling

This is where everything comes together. Once you've got your base facts entered, you can create different scenarios to explore "what-if" situations. Here's how I typically use this:

### Creating Scenarios
Each scenario starts as an exact copy of your base facts, but then you can modify:
- Growth rates
- Retirement ages
- Spending levels
- Individual asset values
- Income timing
- Future events

### Common Scenario Types I Create

1. Market Condition Scenarios
   - "Conservative Growth" (lower return assumptions)
   - "Market Downturn" (negative returns early in retirement)
   - "High Inflation" (increased inflation rate)

2. Retirement Timing Scenarios
   - "Early Retirement"
   - "Phased Retirement"
   - "Work Two More Years"

3. Lifestyle Scenarios
   - "Downsize Home"
   - "Travel More"
   - "Help with Grandkids' College"

4. Social Security Strategies
   - "Both Claim at 62"
   - "Both Wait Until 70"
   - "File and Suspend"

### Scenario Adjustments

What's really powerful is how granular you can get with adjustments. In each scenario, you can:

#### Override Growth Rates
- Change the overall nest egg growth rate
- Modify individual asset growth rates
- Set temporary growth rate adjustments for specific periods

#### Modify Cash Flows
- Change income amounts or timing
- Add or remove expenses
- Adjust inflation settings

#### Adjust Assets and Liabilities
- Change values
- Include/exclude from nest egg
- Modify growth assumptions



## Analysis and Projections

### The Nest Egg Calculator

This is really the heart of FIPLI. For each scenario, it:
- Tracks your nest egg balance year by year
- Calculates investment growth
- Processes all cash flows
- Monitors surplus/deficit

What's particularly useful is how it handles surplus tracking:
- Shows growth on previous surpluses
- Tracks new surplus accumulation
- Projects final positions

I use this to show clients:
- When they might run out of money
- How much cushion they have
- Impact of different spending levels
- Effect of market conditions

### Understanding the Results

FIPLI gives you several key metrics for each scenario:
- Year-by-year nest egg balances
- Total surplus/deficit projections
- Final portfolio values
- Cash flow breakdowns

Pro tip: I always look at the surplus numbers. Even if two scenarios end with the same nest egg balance, the one with higher surplus typically means more flexibility and safety margin.

## Client Presentation Strategies

### Setting Up Meaningful Comparisons

When presenting to clients, I typically create a set of scenarios that tell a story:

1. Base Case
   - Current trajectory
   - Existing assumptions
   - Planned retirement date

2. Conservative Case
   - Lower returns
   - Higher inflation
   - More spending

3. Optimized Strategy
   - Adjusted retirement dates
   - Modified Social Security timing
   - Optimized spending patterns

### Effective Scenario Comparison

Some approaches I've found effective:

#### For Pre-Retirees
- Show impact of working a few more years
- Compare different saving strategies
- Demonstrate power of delayed Social Security

#### For Near-Retirees
- Model different withdrawal strategies
- Compare pension options
- Show impact of downsizing

#### For Retirees
- Test spending sustainability
- Model legacy goals
- Analyze Roth conversion strategies

## Pro Tips and Best Practices

### Setting Up Asset Categories
Create categories that match how your clients think about their money:
- "Safety Money" (cash, short-term bonds)
- "Growth Money" (stocks, real estate)
- "Legacy Assets" (inheritance, life insurance)

### Growth Rate Strategies
- Use conservative rates for base cases
- Create separate scenarios for optimistic/pessimistic views
- Consider using age-based growth rate adjustments

### Cash Flow Modeling
- Always include irregular expenses
- Build in replacement costs for cars, roofs, etc.
- Don't forget about healthcare costs

### Scenario Development
- Start simple, add complexity as needed
- Name scenarios clearly and consistently
- Keep notes on assumptions used

## Real-World Applications

### Client Example 1: Early Retirement Analysis
For a couple considering early retirement:
- Base scenario: Regular retirement age
- Test scenario: Retire 5 years early
- Compare: Different spending levels, Social Security strategies

### Client Example 2: Risk Analysis
For conservative clients worried about market downturns:
- Base scenario: Expected returns
- Test scenarios: Various market conditions
- Show: Impact of different asset allocations

### Client Example 3: Legacy Planning
For clients focused on leaving an inheritance:
- Base scenario: Regular spending
- Test scenarios: Different gifting strategies
- Compare: Impact on retirement security
