# Milestones
- Established direct SQLite database access with validation framework (no ORM)
- Restructured project by functional domains (validation, projections, scenarios) with no abstraction layers
- Built comprehensive schema validation with explicit error handling for tables, relationships, and business rules

# Critical Points
- Queries must stay within functional domains - no shared database layer
- Schema validation must complete successfully before any business logic
